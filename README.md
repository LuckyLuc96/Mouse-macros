# Mouse-macros
f8 = Record Macro, f9 = Stop recording, f10 = Play a recorded macro. Macros get saved in a text file of your choosing. WIP

More GUI should be added soon. This tool was created to repeat simple tasks inside of a video game, but the tool became quite useful and could be use in more scenarios then that. This macro does take your mouse movements and will replay that mouse movement. If you accidentally play a long macro and want to escape, that functionality has not been implemented yet!
